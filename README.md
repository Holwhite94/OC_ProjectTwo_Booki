# ProjectTwo

The brief - Turn Mock-Ups Into a Web Page with HTML & CSS

- Project based on a static image of the desired website 'Booki' which was to promote hotels.  
- I created a basic html 'mock up' where I divided each section and planned out HTML elements in that section. For example, a header section with buttons to navigate. I also added key style points which I would later bring to life using CSS.
- The finished product was a basic mock up of the website with the HTML elements brought to life and styled with CSS to match the initial static image of the website I was given. I then presented this project, explaining the process I followed and passed the project.
